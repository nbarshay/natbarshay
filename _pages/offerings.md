### Research Data Science Support

My experience is that--due to a tragic lack of interdisciplinary cooperation--a great deal of research labor is wasted doing things a computer could do instantly.  In addition, powerful statistical tools which could help with data interpretation go unused or misused due to knowledge barriers.  If any of this sounds familiar, I would love to help.  I work for free because I have that privilege, and because science is important (also, I don't like capitalism).  I'm happy to write code, talk about your data/analysis, and make pretty visualizations.  I can provide ongoing support or help you learn what you need to know to carry on independently.  Email me with a description of your research project and we can go from there.

#### Testimonials

I could have graduated almost a year earlier if I had this code at this start of my PhD, and it took them only an hour to write! Grrrrrrrr." â€” <a href="https://emes.unc.edu/people-indiv/michael-sandstrom/">Dr. Michael Sandstrom</a>
